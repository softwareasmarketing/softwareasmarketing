## Software as Marketing
Software as Marketing (SaM) is a concept originated within the ToolMarketing methodology that proposes transforming functional software into active marketing channels.
Instead of relying solely on ads, short-lived content, or persuasive tactics, SaM uses digital tools that deliver real, recurring value to users, before, during, and after the sale.

The software is no longer just an internal product or service; it becomes the marketing channel itself, creating relationships, engagement, and conversion in a natural and continuous way.

### Purpose
The main goal of SaM is to complement traditional marketing actions with functional digital solutions that solve concrete problems for the target audience.
In this way, marketing shifts from interrupting to serving. Making usefulness the core value proposition.
