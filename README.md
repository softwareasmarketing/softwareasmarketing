# Software as Marketing

**Software as Marketing** is a marketing concept created by strategist **Diego Martinez** as part of the **ToolMarketing (Marketing de Ferramenta)** methodology.

It describes the implementation of a software solution that works as a marketing channel in itself, able to deliver value, collect data, and assemble offers automatically.  
The software is designed to interact directly with the end customer, acting as an intelligent communication channel that can understand user behaviour and determine the best offer at each moment.

## What is the difference between Software as Marketing and Software as Magnet?

**Software as Marketing** is a solution that applies marketing tactics through functionality itself in order to sell a product or service.  
It can interact with the customer, collect data to qualify the lead, and automatically build a personalised offer.  
The software is used on a recurring basis as a marketing channel and, after the initial conversion, it remains relevant to the customer.  
As a marketing asset, the software can also recommend or sell other products, and the people using it should be regarded as customers. They are consumers of the product, not just “users of a tool”.

**Software as Magnet** is when a feature or product is used primarily to attract.  
The focus is on capturing leads or driving an upgrade, not on maintaining an ongoing relationship through that solution.  
The use of the software leads the user to a conversion and, at that point, the software has essentially fulfilled its role.
As bait, in most cases, the software is just a narrow slice of the main product, and the people interacting with it are treated as users. They are users of the software, not customers of an intelligent marketing channel.
